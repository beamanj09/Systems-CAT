# Systems-CAT
thrower robot (mc yeetus deletus) is also currently in development

this is for my Systems CAT, im not exactly sure if i can use Github as my portfolio, but this is for progress log currently

# Internals - Lifting Mechanism
![WIN_20251117_11_38_10_Pro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/549d8ad1-a454-4f7a-976c-230ac7e8c11c)

there will be four motors and four gears conecting to the main shaft, im not exactly sure on what forms of motors i can use for the lifting mechanism, there are two bareings for the main shaft to minimise friction / any forces that will affect the main shaft. 

# Internals - Movement Mechanism
![WIN_20251117_11_48_56_Pro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f080fba-0943-4214-9a80-d50cf649bde3)

there are two DC motors for the movement of the robot, there are again two bareing for the movement to minimise friction / any forces that will affect the movement. the movement (dc motors) will connect to the main motor board so i am able to connect movement to where, go left - left DC motor goes backward - right DC motor goes forward - like how a tank moves

# Internals - Movement and Lifting Mechanism's
![WIN_20251117_12_06_49_Pro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a80e494c-0d4c-4167-b03a-b2570d87360b)

this is both the Lifting Mechanisms and the Movement Mechanisms
- Movement Mechanisms: tank form of movemement. the rear movement (for balance) i will be using a swivel wheel or a ball for the movement
- Lifting Mechanisms: four motors (DC or Servo) connecting to four gears to connect to the main shaft for movenment.
- There are also Bareings to minimise friction / any forces that will affect movement/lifting 

# Potential Troubles with the Project
- 3D printing troubles for both the main shaft, gears,
- programming and how to connect the motors/servo's that doesnt use more than one channel (there is a possability that i need to have the servos on 2 difrent channels since of how i have done the gearing for more torque)
